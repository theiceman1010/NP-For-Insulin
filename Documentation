Tried to integrate stripe in website per instructions: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/quickstart

copied/pasted code from 
'Result HTML CSS JavaScript '
tabs

2 issues to solve
1. getting error 405, not right account. weird b/c there should be some functionality with the standard account. 

2. the css doesn't appear to come through at all either
